## Setup

1. We had created a folder named as ``jsm_banking`` and opened in VS code Editor

2. To initialize this app, I used ``shadcn/cn``. Install and configure Next JS, click on this link [shadcn/cn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next) and Before using next commnad make sure that ``npm`` is install on device, now **Create project** using this command on your terminal ``npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint`` to install in your current directory use ``./``  in-place of ``my-app`` in upper command like this ``npx create-next-app@latest ./ --typescript --tailwind --eslint``

3. **Run the CLI:** Run the ``shadcn-ui``init cmd to setup project ``npx shadcn-ui@latest init``

4. **Set-up Fonts:** In shadcn/ui, it creates a new folder & adds the code only for the components that actually want to use within application, which is not the case for many other UI kits example like Material UI or Boot-strap, there er have install whole library. Run this command in terminal at project directory ``npx shadcn-ui@latest add button``.

5. Delete file from ``app`` folder ``favicon.ico and globals.css``, ``lib``, ``public``, ``tailwind.config.ts`` folder as we create from stratch

## File and Folder Structure
For having a one single layout & managing layoutsv(A layout is specific UI that you can see across multiple pages), like homepages or root pages have one layout and Auth pages have one layout, for achieving this I had use Functionality of ``Next JS``, [Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups).

Delete file ``Finance Management Dashboard/jsm_banking/app/page.tsx`` and create folder named ``(root)`` and create two files inside it named as ``page.tsx`` & ``layout.tsx``

Create Folder and file in that structure:
```
└── 📁app
    └── 📁(auth)
        └── layout.tsx
        └── 📁sign-in
            └── page.tsx
        └── 📁sign-up
            └── page.tsx
    └── 📁(root)
        └── layout.tsx
        └── page.tsx
    └── globals.css
    └── layout.tsx
```
Now we will our application through this command ``npm run dev``
